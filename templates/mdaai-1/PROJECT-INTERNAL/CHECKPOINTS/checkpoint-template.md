AI ASSISTANT INSTRUCTIONS - CHECKPOINT TEMPLATE
================================================================================

This template defines the structure for all checkpoint documents. When creating
a checkpoint, the AI Assistant MUST follow these rules:

BEFORE CREATING THE CHECKPOINT:
1. Perform Knowledge Base Synchronization (see CHECKPOINT-PROTOCOL.md Article 3)
   - Review and update PROJECT-DEVELOPMENT-ELABORATION.md
   - Review and update relevant ADRs
   - Review and update DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md if APIs changed
   - Review and update DEVELOPMENT-PRACTICES.md if new patterns emerged
   - Update registry.json with any new work orders
   - Update README.md if user-facing features changed

2. Run all tests and verify system stability

3. Gather all information needed to fill this template

FILLING THIS TEMPLATE:
- Replace all [BRACKETED_PLACEHOLDERS] with actual values
- CP-XXX: Use next sequential number (check existing checkpoints)
- Delete this instruction block from the final document
- Preserve all section headings even if a section is "None"
- Use tables for structured data
- Include verification commands that actually work

NAMING THE FILE:
- Format: CP-XXX-PHASE-Y-DESCRIPTION.md
- Example: CP-002-PHASE-7-COMPLETE.md
- Example: CP-003-MILESTONE-AUTH-SYSTEM.md
